## 5 Things You Need to Know About the Costs to Own a Website

Do you know that there are many tools out there that can create your own website? There are also even free tools to create your website, but they come with substantial limitations when you decide to scale. By all means, you may want to start with the free website tools like *Weebly, Carrd,* and a handful more. However, when it comes to creating custom designs, content, and features, a WordPress website is the way to go. It's a lot more reliable in terms of customization.

### Here are the must-have components of a website to run:

1. **Domain name (SGD 15 per year)** - A typical domain name like www.yourname.com, and it doesn't come for free.
2. **Hosting (SGD 120 per year)** - This is where your website lives. A server hosts your website for visitors around the world to visit.
3. **CMS (Usually Free)** - Content Management System, here is where you build your website, settings, configurations, and design. If you are using WordPress, it is free.
4. **Website Builder (SGD 120 per year)** - This is a program on top of your CMS to design your website. Examples include Elementor, Divi, Beaver, and many other web-builders.
5. **Other apps (SGD 150 per year)** - This may not be the case for you, but some features you want for your website may not come for free. These are called plugins.

The prices above are based on the average minimum cost needed for a website to run perfectly and still be able to scale further in the future. Based on the prices above, the total cost for one year would be around SGD 405. That is SGD 34 per month. What do you think about owning a website with your choice of domain (www.yourname.com) for SGD 34 per month?

Oh, not to forget, under the hosting, you will also be able to create multiple business emails like "*gerald\@yourname.com*." This creates an impression that your entity has credibility towards your clients and customers. It creates trust and a sense of security when they engage you. A typical common business email costs about SGD 8 per email per month, that is SGD 96 per year. You don't have to worry about this because your hosting provides a business email.

### Conclusion

This average minimum cost means that you can start small and expand later. Businesses experience different needs at different points. With a WordPress website, your capability to expand is limitless. However, there is another cost factor that I didn't mention, and that is *"Time".* You will need a lot of time to develop the website, and that is when website agencies come into play. They handle all the IT stuff, set the correct configurations, security, and website speed. There are countless configurations for each feature you want, and you might not want your website to break, so leave it to the experts to do all that for you.
