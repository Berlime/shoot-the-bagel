## The Best & Cheap Hosting Providers for Starters in 2025

In today's new year topic, let's discuss which hosting providers to choose for your new website in Singapore. There are in-depth details about what to look for when choosing hosting providers. There is a good read in 2020 by [*Cardinal Digital*](https://www.cardinaldigital.com/insights/best-cheap-web-hosting-solutions-in-singapore-2020), a digital marketing expert based in Singapore if you want to know in-depth details on hosting providers.

This recommendation is based on these criteria:

* Simple and friendly control panel (Do not use the conventional *cPanel*)
* No need to configure HTML or coding, just clicks of buttons
* Widely used by Singaporeans
* Powerful and reliable support
* Has a Singapore-based server

However, let's talk about the best and proven hosting provider that has been around for years. More importantly, they have servers that are based *locally* in Singapore. Let's now get straight into it and number 3 will *shock* you.

## 1. Hostinger

This European web host is the most *popular* choice for starters. Starting from **SGD 4 per month** with a free domain name for 1 year. It is the most *logical* choice to choose as your first time creating a website. Click [*here*](https://www.hostinger.com/wordpress-hosting) to view the official website pricing. The price on the website is in USD.

This has been the best choice to start small with since they have 24/7 chat support instead of the *ticket* type of support. This is ideal as a starter where things can get confusing at times and you are just a chat away.

[Hostinger](https://hostinger.com) also provides advanced plans whenever you are ready to scale up the contents and features within your website.

With only SGD 4 per month *you have to take up the 48-months plan to qualify for this price*. Do you think it has an impact on your financial *plans* to have a website?

## 2. Siteground

The United States hosting company is known for its reliability and speed no matter the size of the website. Their server is based on the latest hardware available and they constantly update their own infrastructure to cater to the vast growing internet. [Siteground](https://siteground.com) is the *smart* choice if your plans for the website are big or at least whenever you need it, Siteground has all it takes to handle more visitors.

Siteground's cheapest WordPress hosting starts from **SGD 8 per month** for the first year. After one year, the price increases to **SGD 21 per month**. This may appear a *little* expensive compared to Hostinger's cheap plans. Here's the catch: Siteground serves your website as *"future proof"*. For example, what if one day, for some reason, your website is getting **hundreds** of visitors at the same time? Or as easy as what if your website needs **hundreds** of photo files, and video files to showcase your business? Siteground handles it efficiently.

Here are 5 key points to better understand why paying a *little* more for Siteground is worth it:

1. Uses the latest hardware and software for their servers
2. High-speed platforms and [*technology*](https://www.siteground.com/technology)
3. More than enough to support **a lot** of content
4. Great if you want more advanced features
5. Great tutorials on YouTube if you ever get stuck

With a brief idea of what Siteground offers, do you think it is worth paying a *little* more?

## 3. Exabytes SG

We have seen the European hosting giant and the United States popular hosting companies. Let me introduce you to a Singapore-based company, [**Exabytes**](https://exabytes.sg). As a Singaporean, at least you can get a sense of security that it is locally based. This means your support messages can easily be understood *linguistically* as a local.

Their "[*WP12 Beginner*](https://www.exabytes.sg/web-hosting/wordpress-hosting)" plan costs **SGD 3.99 per month**. You can get your website up and running with peace of mind knowing that you are in good hands in Singapore. The most awesome *thing* about Exabytes is that you can purchase a Singapore domain together with your hosting plan.

* `https://yourname.com.sg` (note the ".com.sg" is for registered companies)
* `https://yourname.sg` (anyone with [*SingPass*](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main) can register ".sg") basically anyone with Singapore citizenship.

It is a good practice to have your domain name provider and hosting provider with the same company as it integrates well and you can manage just one admin panel or your *"accounts dashboard"*. Well, what is the *shocking* part of it? Think of it again, a hosting provider that is based in the same country speaks for itself. With the capabilities to scale further, fast and secure, Exabytes may be right for you. At least for a *Singaporean*.

With my in-depth research, Exabytes have the most *authentic* customer reviews.
